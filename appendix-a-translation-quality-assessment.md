Table 4 shows the four (4) **structural** and **process** -related quality characteristics and associated quality metrics that have a **SMART** rating of **GREEN** are considered suitable for use by IHTSDO and mature enough for immediate use, and translation projects should consider them mandatory for use:

| Component | Quality Characteristic                                                                                                               | SMART Rating                                |
